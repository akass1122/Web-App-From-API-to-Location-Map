# FromAPItoLocationMap

This web application is deployed on Azure:   http://express-l2y6p2.azurewebsites.net/public/Volta_Andrei_K.html

This web application takes public API of company Volta Charging and searches for closest charging stations to the address, entered in the search box or all charging stations of a city.
It displays these stations on Google Map and also shows them in a table.

By default the table's rows are sorted by distance to the entered address.
By clicking on a column's header you can sort the table's rows by this column.
Clicking on a name of a station in the table will show this station on Google Map.

This is a coding challenge from Volta Charging.
